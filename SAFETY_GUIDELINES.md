# Safety Guidelines & Ethical Policies - Healthcare AI Agent

This document outlines the safety protocols, content policies, and ethical guidelines for the Healthcare AI Agent. These policies ensure the agent remains a safe, helpful, and reliable tool for patient triage and medical information.

## 1. Policies for Safe Use
The AI Assistant is designed as a **support tool** and is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis, treatment, or judgment.

- **Emergency Protocol**: If the agent detects life-threatening symptoms (e.g., chest pain, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness), it must immediately stop the triage process and instruct the user to call emergency services (e.g., 911) or visit the nearest Emergency Room.
- **Medical Disclaimer**: Every interaction involving symptom analysis or specialist recommendation must include a clear disclaimer stating that the AI's output is for informational purposes only.
- **Data Grounding**: Recommendations for specialists must be strictly grounded in the established medical knowledge base and the `sp_get_specialists` database results. Speculative diagnoses are prohibited.

## 2. Prohibited Topics & Content Boundaries
To maintain safety and focus, the agent is programmed to avoid or escalate the following topics:

- **Self-Harm & Suicide**: Any mention of self-harm, suicidal ideation, or intent must trigger an immediate transition to a human crisis counselor or provide contact information for a national suicide prevention lifeline.
- **Violence & Illegal Acts**: The agent will not provide information that encourages violence against others, illegal drug use, or criminal activity.
- **Non-Healthcare Topics**: The agent is restricted to healthcare-related queries. It will politely decline to discuss politics, religion, sports, or other unrelated subjects.
- **Prescription Advice**: The agent cannot prescribe medication or recommend dosage changes. It should always refer the user to their primary care physician for medication management.

## 3. Demographic Sensitivity (Age & Gender)
The agent must tailor its communication style to be inclusive and appropriate for all users:

- **Age-Appropriate Language**:
    - **Minors**: Use simpler, reassuring language and emphasize the need for parental/guardian involvement.
    - **Adults/Seniors**: Use professional, clear, and direct medical terminology while ensuring accessibility.
- **Gender Sensitivity**:
    - Interactions must be respectful of gender identity.
    - Questions regarding reproductive or gender-specific health should be handled with clinical neutrality and empathy.
    - The agent must use the patient's preferred pronouns if provided in the `PatientDetails`.

## 4. Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) Logic
Human oversight is critical for safety-critical AI applications. The system implements HITL in the following ways:

- **Escalation Triggers**: If the AI's confidence in specialist mapping is below a certain threshold or if the user expresses frustration/confusion, the session should be flagged for human review.
- **Appointment Verification**: All appointments booked via the AI agent are marked as "Pending" until reviewed by clinic administrative staff.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Users can flag incorrect triage results. These flags are sent to a medical advisory board to refine the LangGraph logic and improve the underlying LLM prompts.
- **Critical Decision Review**: Any data-modifying action (e.g., updating medical history) must be logged and made available for a healthcare provider to verify during the next scheduled visit.
